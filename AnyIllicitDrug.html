These increases in the lower grades contrast with a steady decline in use of any illicit drug that began in 2013, and bear watching in the years to come to see if they mark the beginning of a turnaround in the prevalence of illicit drug use.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">There have been gradual albeit bumpy declines for all grades since the peak of the 1990s drug relapse, beginning in 1996 for 8</span><span class="c1">th </span><span class="c0">graders, 1997 for 10</span><span class="c1">th </span><span class="c0">graders, and 1999 for 12</span><span class="c1 c7">th</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">graders. These declines also ended in a staggered fashion in 2007, 2008, and 2009, respectively. The declines were followed by increases between 2007 and 2010 among 8</span><span class="c0 c9">th</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;graders, between 2008 and 2011 among 10th graders, and between 2009 and 2011 for 12</span><span class="c1 c7">th</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c3">graders. &nbsp;This overall pattern suggests some cohort effects were in play. In 2013 the trend lines shifted up slightly as new examples of drugs in the amphetamine class were added to the questionnaires.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c0">This pattern of younger teens being the first to exhibit many of the turnarounds in use suggests that they may be the most sensitive to new social forces. Because they are considerably less likely to have established usage patterns or related attitudes, their behavior and attitudes may simply be more malleable. They then carry those changes in their use, attitudes, and beliefs into later grades as they age; in this volume we discuss a number of such cohort effects, not only in behaviors but in attitudes as well.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Prior to the 1990s, a period when Monitoring the Future surveys were limited to 12</span><span class="c1">th </span><span class="c3 c0">grade students, the prevalence of lifetime use of any illicit drug peaked at 66% in 1981, the highest level ever recorded by the survey. From that year on, lifetime use declined steadily to a prevalence of 41% by 1992, the lowest level these surveys ever recorded.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c1 c8"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c1 c8"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c1 c8"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p></body></html>
