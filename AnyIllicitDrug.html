Because they are considerably less likely to have established usage patterns or related attitudes, their behavior and attitudes may simply be more malleable. They then carry those changes in their behaviors and attitudes into later grades as they age; in this volume we discuss a number of such cohort effects.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;Prior to the 1990s, a period when Monitoring the Future surveys were limited to 12</span><span class="c0">th </span><span class="c0 c2">grade students, the</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;prevalence of lifetime use of any illicit drug peaked at 66% in 1981, the highest level ever recorded by the survey.
